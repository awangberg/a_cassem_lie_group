        "Generative writing is a process for documenting thoughts, questions, patterns, hunches, findings, and interesting things as you work on your project.

You might revisit them. Or revise them. Or scrap them.  Or rely upon them for major findings for your paper.  We don't know how you'll use the idea in the future - but writing it down ensures it is there for you to use later.\n",
